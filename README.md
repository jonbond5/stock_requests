## This repo is being split into 2 since Alpha Vantage (https://alphavantage.co) has the tools I need already built
### Overview
Originally this was a repo for technical trading indicators.  Custom legacy indicators will be left in a 'legacy' branch, but moving forward I'll be using AlphaVantage.

## Usage
### Grabbing AV key
Make sure you have an AV key (see link above to get one)
File `AV.txt` is NOT tracked by git - put just your key in there.
